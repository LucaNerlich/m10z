# Configuration & Infrastructure

Secure configuration is foundational to application security, influencing how systems are deployed and maintained.

## Environment Configuration

- Use environment-specific configuration files
- Implement secure defaults for all environments
- Minimize configuration differences between environments
- Document all configuration options
- Apply infrastructure as code principles

## Secrets Management

- Never hardcode secrets in source code
- Use dedicated secrets management tools
- Implement secure secret rotation
- Apply principle of least privilege for secrets access
- Audit secret access and usage

## Containerization Security

- Use minimal base images
- Run containers as non-root users
- Implement container security scanning
- Apply resource restrictions
- Keep container images updated

## Security Headers & Settings

- Implement secure HTTP headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options)
- Configure Content Security Policy
- Apply cookie security attributes
- Configure CORS policies appropriately
- Disable directory listings

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Using default passwords or credentials
- Exposing unnecessary services or ports
- Enabling unnecessary features or modules
- Using insecure defaults
- Failing to harden infrastructure components
- Neglecting consistent configuration across environments
