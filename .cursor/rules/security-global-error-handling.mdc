# Error Handling & Logging

Proper error handling and logging are critical for both security monitoring and preventing information leakage.

## Secure Error Handling

- Implement centralized error handling
- Apply different handling for different environments
- Never expose stack traces or system details to users
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Use appropriate HTTP status codes

## Logging Best Practices

- Implement structured logging
- Log security-relevant events
- Include contextual information in logs
- Apply appropriate log levels
- Protect sensitive information in logs

## Security Monitoring

- Implement centralized log collection
- Configure alerts for security events
- Establish baseline behavior patterns
- Implement automated log analysis
- Maintain audit trails for sensitive operations

## Logging Security Events

- Authentication attempts (successful and failed)
- Authorization failures
- Input validation failures
- System configuration changes
- Data access and modification operations

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Exposing stack traces to end users
- Logging sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII)
- Using inconsistent error handling approaches
- Neglecting to log security events
- Implementing custom logging solutions without security review
